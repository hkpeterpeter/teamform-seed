# teamform-seed
## The seed project for the team forming web application


## Recommendation Algorithm 1.0
 1. getting training data set:Google/Twitter(hashtag)
 2. generating word vectors: word2vec
 3. caculating the matching scores between users and events: 
       using skills&interests tags from users and events
       caculating similarities between two tags using the result of word2vec
       averaging scores using (S1^2+S2^2+...+Sn^2)/(S1+S2+...+Sn)
 4. caculating the matching scores between users and teams: 
       using skills tags from users and skills(&needs) tags from teams 
       caculating similarities between two tags using the result of word2vec
       averaging scores using (S1^2+S2^2+...+Sn^2)/(S1+S2+...+Sn)

```

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

 We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* all unit test cases should be written inside the folder `app/unit_tests`

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. 
In this course, we will mainly focus on the branch and statement coverage. 
The output files will be stored inside the `app/coverage` folder. 

## Addtional information for COMP3111H students

Besides from web development, COMP3111H team needs to work on a mobile app (iOS and Android). We recommend your team to use Ionic framework [http://ionicframework.com/] (http://ionicframework.com/). Ionic framework is based on AngularJS. Features completed in Angular can be easily ported to Ionic.
